## ICP Burn Rate Calculator v2.2

Some JS logic to calculate the network wide burn rate of ICP in minutes based off of the XDR>ICP conversion rate and the network wide cycles/s burn rate. Refreshes every 12 seconds.

A deployed on-chain version can be found live here:

Planned Updates:

* Modularize into a UI component and a separate functional component for use on websites as a plugin.
* Addition of a rust canister that can act as an API and data logging canister to eventually create and serve past data.
